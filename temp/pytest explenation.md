The provided code snippet looks good! It defines a `SECRET_KEY` for your application and sets up an in-memory database fixture using `pytest.fixture`. You also have well-structured test cases for creating, updating, and deleting contacts, including tests for invalid data and non-existent contacts.

Here are some additional points to consider:

* **Error Handling:** While you're testing for successful scenarios, consider adding tests that verify how your application handles unexpected errors like database connection issues or invalid data formats.
* **Testing Form Validation:** If your application utilizes forms for creating or updating contacts, you might want to write tests that ensure proper validation occurs for required fields and data types.
* **Testing Edge Cases:** Think about edge cases for your functionalities. For example, could someone create a contact with an empty name? How would your application handle that? 
* **Testing with Real Data:** While in-memory databases are efficient for testing, consider running a subset of your tests with a real database to ensure everything works as expected in a production environment.

Overall, the provided code demonstrates a good foundation for testing your Flask application's contact management functionalities. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can create a more comprehensive test suite that covers various scenarios and ensures the robustness of your application.
